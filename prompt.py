An abandoned area left in ruins since the civil war.
 The ground is littered with abandoned objects and debris: wrecked cars and crushed tanks lying among piles of rubble. 
 Cracks and fractured surfaces are everywhere. 
 Bullet holes and bright graffiti and tags cover the walls, creating a stark contrast against the crumbling structures. 
 The atmosphere is eerie and dark, reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic setting. 
 The scene is captured with high photographic realism, respecting the original quality of the photo without applying any particular style, making the image appear as realistic as possible. The focus is on the abandoned objects, scattered debris, bullet holes, and graffiti, emphasizing the overwhelming desolation. The scene is captured with a FUJIFILM X-T5 camera, using 35mm focal length at 53mm, with a Æ’/1.4 aperture, 1/320s shutter speed, ISO 125, and +2/3 exposure compensation"
