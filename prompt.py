PROMPT_GENERAL = '''
An abandoned area left in ruins since the civil war.
 The ground is littered with abandoned objects and debris: wrecked cars and crushed tanks lying among piles of rubble. 
 Cracks and fractured surfaces are everywhere. 
 Bullet holes and bright graffiti and tags cover the walls, creating a stark contrast against the crumbling structures. 
 The atmosphere is eerie and dark, reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic setting. 
 The scene is captured with high photographic realism, respecting the original quality of the photo without applying any particular style, making the image appear as realistic as possible. The focus is on the abandoned objects, scattered debris, bullet holes, and graffiti, emphasizing the overwhelming desolation. The scene is captured with a FUJIFILM X-T5 camera, using 35mm focal length at 53mm, with a ƒ/1.4 aperture, 1/320s shutter speed, ISO 125, and +2/3 exposure compensation"

STEP1_PROMPT = '''
The city shows the first signs of decay following a severe economic collapse. 
The buildings and roads are slightly deteriorated, with visible cracks on the pavement and some broken windows. 
However, traces of life remain – a few scattered cars, and some refugee tents are starting to appear, set up in parks and abandoned parking lots. 
The atmosphere is tense but still relatively calm, with a sense of uncertainty hanging in the air. 
Dim sunlight filters through the clouds, casting long shadows over the scene.
'''


STEP2_PROMPT = '''
Scenes of violence and looting have erupted between survivors, 
leaving the city in chaos. Buildings are partially destroyed, 
with bullet holes riddling the walls and large craters on the roads from explosions. 
Graffiti and desperate messages are spray-painted across surfaces. Smoke rises in the distance, and debris litters the streets. 
Cars are overturned, some burned-out. 
The air is thick with dust, and the few remaining people hide or scavenge among the wreckage, hinting at a brutal fight for survival.
'''

STEP3_PROMPT = '''
The city is now completely abandoned, a ghost town overtaken by nature. 
Buildings are in ruins, collapsing under their own weight. 
The streets are cracked, with plants and vines pushing through the asphalt and creeping up the walls. 
Trees and tall grass have grown wildly in the middle of the once-bustling roads. No humans are in sight, 
and the city is eerily quiet except for the sound of wind rustling through the leaves. 
The few remaining cars are rusting, partially swallowed by the greenery.
'''

STEP4_PROMPT = '''
The city is entirely engulfed by nature, almost unrecognizable under the dense vegetation. 
Trees have sprouted on rooftops, and thick vines wrap around what’s left of the skeletal buildings. 
Moss and ivy cover every surface, and wild animals roam freely through the once-urban environment. 
The roads are now barely visible beneath a carpet of grass and flowers. 
The sky is overcast, with shafts of sunlight breaking through, illuminating the remnants of the forgotten city. 
Silence reigns, only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves
